Video game toxicity: negative, abusive, and disrespectful behavior towards other players. 
Examples of toxic behavior are griefing and verbal harassment. 
Griefing is intentionally ruining the gaming experience of other players. Examples include bullying lower level players or purposely aiding the enemy team instead of yours. 
Toxic language includes using profanity, calling players derogatory names, or insulting players' skills. 
Reporting the player, muting or blocking them, or exiting the game are effective strategies against toxic players. 
Responding with toxic behavior of your own is not an effective way to deal with toxic behavior as it only perpetuates the cycle of toxicity. 
Toxic behavior can decrease enjoyment and negatively impact teamwork. 
Promoting positive behavior is a great way to create an enjoyable gaming experience for all players. 
Encouraging players to work together towards a common goal, congratulating opponents on a well-played game, and offering help to other players can promote positive behavior. 
Taunting opponents, insulting players who make mistakes, and cheating are not effective in promoting positive behavior, but rather promote toxic behavior. 
Addressing the root causes of toxic behavior by providing education and training on proper conduct and behavior, and creating guidelines on acceptable behavior can reduce toxic behavior. 
Collaborative efforts from players, game developers, and administrators will create a gaming environment that is enjoyable and welcoming for all players.
