The runnable JAR file contains the runnable JAR. 
The source code file contains all the source code. GameMain is the  driver class that is responsible for running the program. 
All the files are only guaranteed to work in jGrasp. 
Our game requires a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse. Trackpad will also work but is not preferable for the action level.


When clicking, since we overrode Java's MouseClicked method, the mouse must not move between pressing down and releasing, otherwise Java will not recognize it as clicking. This does not affect shooting in the game as we only check for MousePress and MouseRelease. 
The game may be hard to get a grasp of as it is designed to be challenging. 
In the learning level, some text might be slightly hard to read because the way we organized it on visual studio code at home does not organize the same way in eclipse, and maybe jGrasp. This only affects the second card in the first row in the learning level due to its slightly extensive length.


General Tips
All levels will begin with an instructions/introduction screen, and pressing continue will allow you to proceed to the next main contents of the level. After completing a level, there will be two buttons, one which says continue and another which says menu or main menu. Clicking on main menu will allow you to return to the main menu, while clicking on the continue button will allow you to move to the next level. In the top left corner, these is a button which allows you to exit to the main menu at any time. You can exit by clicking on the exit button in the main menu.


Learn Level Instructions
There will be 12 gray cards, which can be clicked on to learn more about video game toxicity and how to combat it. Click again on the screen again after reading the card to return to the main screen with all 12 cards. Once a card has been read, it will turn green to indicate that you have already read it. You can still click on the green cards again if you wish to review the information. Once all 12 cards have turned green, a continue button will appear in the bottom right.


Maze Level Instructions
Navigate the maze by using either the WASD or Arrow keys to move around your character. In the middle of each crossroad, there will be a sign. Walking close to the sign will make it pop up, allowing you to read the question. It will show a multiple choice question and give 3 possible answers, with each answer corresponding to a certain direction, minus the one from which you came. Walking in the wrong direction will lead to a dead end. After correctly answering 5 questions, a glowing door will appear and walking close enough to it will lead you to the Action level.


Action Level Instructions
The action level is a test of your knowledge of video game toxicity and how to combat it, coupled with live action gameplay against a toxic video game opponent. Using either the WASD keys or the Arrow keys to move, and holding down the left mouse button to shoot, fight against an enemy while fighting off their toxicity. Responding successfully to the scenarios will give you a buff, such as higher damage, more hp, faster reload, or higher movement spead, and an incorrect answer will not lose anything. The level is finished when either you or the opponent has been defeated.
